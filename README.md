- 👋 Hi, I’m @YungTehror
- 👀 I’m interested in ...creating art, crypto, community improvement and cohesion, and creating my own business that helps attract tomorrows generation to, and educate and prepare them for the next step in our evolutionary process, and how to use all the tools at their disposal to become greater than those of us that came before. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...more about nft creation, block-/game-/RegenFi and digital art design, it's more streamlined than hand drawn/painted pieces.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...NFTs, projects that can help me gain traction in my goal to bring crypto/fin/tax awareness and knowledge enrichment to the historically underserved, disparaged and minority groups here locally and ultimately nationwide. I am also open to music/movie/game/anime/crypto suggestions 
- 📫 How to reach me ...I'm on x @NatachoWeldz Tele @YungTehror Discord @NatachoWeldz
